Are you attempting to create an instance of a mutable value type? If so, you should strongly consider changing the design of the value type. However, if you are unable to do so, you can add the {1} customizations to your Fixture instance:
var fixture = new Fixture();
var customization = new {1}();
customization.Customize(fixture);
