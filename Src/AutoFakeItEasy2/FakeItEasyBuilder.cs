    [Obsolete("The AutoFakeItEasy2 package has been retired; use the AutoFakeItEasy (without the trailing \"2\") package instead. Details: it's turned out that it's possible to enable AutoFakeItEasy to also work with FakeItEasy 2. From version 3.49.1, you should be able to use AutoFakeItEasy with FakeItEasy 2 by adding an assembly binding redirect. This enables us, the maintainers of AutoFixture, to maintain only one code base for FakeItEasy, instead of two. If this causes problems, please create an issue at https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/issues. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.")]
